Phase 7 — Scenarios & Disruptions (M4)

Tests that all Phase 7 scenario files run end-to-end with B1 and B2 baselines.

Scenarios covered:
- E1: Normal day (baseline)
- E2: High-demand event (placement drive, multiplier 1.8x)
- E3: Parking lot closure (tests diversion)
- E4: Gate closure (tests queue buildup)
- E5: Robustness with forecast noise (0%, 10%, 20%)
