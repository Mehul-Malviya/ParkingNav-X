"""
Part 4's seam: the AllocationStrategy interface. The simulation engine
never decides which lot a vehicle goes to -- it only calls whatever
strategy it's handed, exactly once per vehicle at the parking_search step,
and then enforces the physical constraints (closed/full lot, closed road,
gate throughput) regardless of what the strategy returned.

Member 3 implements First Available, Nearest Available, and the final
optimizer against this exact interface. FixedLotStrategy below exists only
to prove, in this module's own tests, that the interface is actually being
called and not bypassed -- it is not a real allocation strategy.
